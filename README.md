## Description

This is simple script to update my airtable with market data for my portfolio. 

## How it works

1. Copy airtable base here https://airtable.com/shrxaLz4SqWd069wm
2. Manually input your portfolio (Product, Ticker, Number of shares)
3. Get airtable api credentials to your base
4. Run this script

Airtable has two main tables. First lists your portfolio items

Seconds is for creating your alocation strategy. It allows you to group items. For example I group most of my stock picks into single pile, because they don't fit my current strategy. I have several China ETFs that I group into Emerging Markets. All crypto are crypto as far as my strategy goes. This allows me to save a lot of time. When I need to buy all I need to do is to look into this table and see where my current holding is below ideas and purchase that without thinking.
